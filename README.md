# Unix-Projects
Bash scripts - Assignments 1 and 2... School server is terrible so I have to retype them when I get the chance then upload them.
C code - Assignments 3+

Projects 3+ were written in C90 as the school server runs C90 and the code was going to be compiled off the school server. Though the code was written in the Clion IDE (as it lets me select the version of C which I want to write my code in).
